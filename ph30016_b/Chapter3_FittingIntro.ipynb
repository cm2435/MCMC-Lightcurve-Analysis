    "## Background - What is the purpose of fitting and modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will consider the methods of fitting models to data, specifically, least square minimization. But before we go on to look into the detail, we will first consider why we are fitting data and therefore what choices should be made to ensure we are getting a reliable and meaningful answer.\n",

    "Have a look at the following xkcd comic:\n",
    "\n",
    "[How to choose your model](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/curve_fitting_2x.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss the comic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential uses for fitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- parameter estimation when the underlying mathematical form is known. Example, finding the velocity of an object moving at constant velocity, e.g.: x(t) = a*t + x_0\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model comparison. If the underlying physics are not known, determine which of several models fits the data best. Example: is a moving object accelarating or moving at constant velocity?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing a specific model: testing if a spevific model fits the data. Example: is the moving object accelarating?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit a discriptive model to data with unknown physics. Example: you have collected some new exiting data and would like to describe the data in a mathematical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential dangers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Excessive complexity and overfitting: increasing the complexity of a model will result in an improvement in the fit. We will need to compensate for model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fitting a model to data, but failing to determine if it fits better than other possible models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not reaching the global minimum: we will be varying the free parameters, this might not always lead to the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common joke is that for noisy datasets, \"you could fit an elephant to that data\". This generally refers to a situation in which any sensibly complex model will fit the data, therefore not allowing to test for any specific model. You can see [How to fit an elephant to data](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/FittingAnElephant/) here."
